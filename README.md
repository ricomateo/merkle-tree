# merkle-tree
A very basic implementation of a merkle tree.

### Features
* A Merkle Tree can be built out of an array.
* A Merkle Tree can generate a proof that it contains an element.
* A Merkle Tree can verify that a given hash is contained in it.
* A Merke Tree can be dynamic, this means that elements can be added once it is built.

### Tests
You can run the tests with `cargo test`.

### Documentation
The documentation can be built with `cargo doc` and it is located in `target/doc/merkle_tree/index.html`.
